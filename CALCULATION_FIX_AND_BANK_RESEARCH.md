# ‚úÖ Calculation Fix & Comprehensive Bank Research

## üêõ Issues Found & Fixed

### **1. TRANSFER Transactions Not Counted** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:**
```kotlin
TransactionType.TRANSFER -> {
    // NOT being counted in income or expenses!
    Log.d("HomeViewModel", "Transfer: ${transaction.merchant}")
}
```

**Impact:**
- UPI person-to-person transfers were not counted
- Money going out was not reflected in expenses
- Balance calculation was WRONG!

**Fix:**
```kotlin
TransactionType.TRANSFER -> {
    // FIXED: Treat transfers as expenses (money going out)
    totalExpenses += transaction.amount
    currentMonthExpenses += transaction.amount
    Log.d("HomeViewModel", "Transfer (counted as expense): -‚Çπ${transaction.amount}")
}
```

### **2. Limited Bank Support** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Before:** Only 25 banks supported
**After:** 80+ banks supported!

---

### **3. Inconsistent Bank Lists** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Different files had different bank lists
- `SMSManager.kt`: 30 banks
- `TransactionSMSReceiver.kt`: 15 banks
- `SMSReader.kt`: 15 banks

**Fix:** Created centralized `BankConstants.kt` with 80+ banks

## üìä Calculation Logic (Fixed)

### **Before (WRONG):**
```kotlin
CREDIT  ‚Üí Income ‚úÖ
DEBIT   ‚Üí Expense ‚úÖ
TRANSFER ‚Üí Nothing ‚ùå (NOT COUNTED!)

Balance = Income - Expenses
(Transfers ignored!)
```

### **After (CORRECT):**
```kotlin
CREDIT  ‚Üí Income ‚úÖ
DEBIT   ‚Üí Expense ‚úÖ
TRANSFER ‚Üí Expense ‚úÖ (Money going out)

Balance = Income - (Expenses + Transfers)
(All money movements counted!)
```
