### **Problems Fixed:**

1. ✅ **SMS processing runs ONLY ONCE** (first app launch)
2. ✅ **No duplicate transactions** (multi-level duplicate prevention)
3. ✅ **Background auto-processing** (new SMS processed automatically)
4. ✅ **Smart duplicate detection** (by SMS body + amount + time + merchant)

## 🛡️ Duplicate Prevention (Multi-Level)

### **Level 1: SMS Body Check**
```kotlin
// Check if SMS already processed
val existingBySms = transactionDao.getTransactionsBySmsBody(sms.smsBody)
if (existingBySms != null) {
    Log.d("SMSManager", "⏭️ Duplicate: Transaction exists with same SMS body, skipping")
    return
}
```

### **Level 2: Amount + Time + Merchant Check**
```kotlin
// Check by amount + timestamp + merchant (within 1 minute tolerance)
val timeWindow = 60000L // 1 minute in milliseconds
val existingByDetails = transactionDao.getTransactionByAmountAndTime(
    details.amount,
    sms.timestamp - timeWindow,
    sms.timestamp + timeWindow
)
if (existingByDetails != null && existingByDetails.merchant == details.merchant) {
    Log.d("SMSManager", "⏭️ Duplicate: Similar transaction exists, skipping")
    return
}
```

### **Level 3: SMS Database Check**
```kotlin
// Check if SMS already in PaymentSms table
val existingSms = paymentSmsDao.getSMSByBodyAndSender(messageBody, sender)
if (existingSms != null) {
    Log.d("TransactionSMS", "⏭️ SMS already exists, skipping")
    return
}
```

## 🚀 Background Auto-Processing

**Now automatically:**
1. ✅ Detects new payment SMS
2. ✅ Checks for duplicates (3 levels)
3. ✅ Extracts transaction details
4. ✅ Categorizes automatically
5. ✅ Creates transaction in database

} else {
    // Already processed - go directly to HOME
    // Background service will handle new SMS automatically
    _navigationEvent.emit(NavigationDestination.HOME)
