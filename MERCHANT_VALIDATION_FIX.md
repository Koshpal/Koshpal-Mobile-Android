# ✅ Merchant Name Validation Fix - "Bankar" Surname Issue

## 🐛 **Problem Found**

**User Issue:**
- ✅ **Working:** "You have received... from mr shivam dinesh atr..."
- ❌ **Not Working:** "You have received... from karan arjun bankar..."

Both messages were identical except for the merchant name!

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

### **The Bug:**
```kotlin
// OLD CODE (WRONG):
val invalidMerchants = listOf("bank", "upi", "transfer", ...)

for (invalid in invalidMerchants) {
    if (cleanMerchant.contains(invalid)) return false  // ❌ Substring match!
}
```

**What Happened:**
```
Merchant: "karan arjun bankar"
Check: "karan arjun bankar".contains("bank") = ✅ TRUE
Result: ❌ REJECTED AS INVALID!
```

**The Problem:**
- "Bankar" is a **common Indian surname** (like Singh, Sharma, etc.)
- The code checked for **substring "bank"** in "bankar"
- False positive! "Bankar" ≠ "bank"

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **Fixed Code:**
```kotlin
// NEW CODE (CORRECT):
val words = cleanMerchant.split("\\s+".toRegex())  // Split into words

for (word in words) {
    if (word in invalidMerchants) {  // ✅ Exact word match!
        return false
    }
}
```

**How It Works Now:**
```
Merchant: "karan arjun bankar"
Words: ["karan", "arjun", "bankar"]
Check each word:
  - "karan" in invalidMerchants? → ✅ NO
  - "arjun" in invalidMerchants? → ✅ NO
  - "bankar" in invalidMerchants? → ✅ NO (exact match, not substring!)
Result: ✅ VALID MERCHANT!
```

## 📝 **Invalid Merchant List**

These are **rejected only as whole words**:

```kotlin
"unknown", "merchant", "payment", "transaction", "transfer", 
"debit", "credit", "bank", "upi", "imps", "neft", "rtgs",
"pos", "atm", "cash", "withdrawal", "deposit", "balance",
"sms", "alert", "notification", "service", "charge", "fee"
```

**Examples:**
- ❌ "bank" → Invalid (generic term)
- ✅ "banker" → Valid (surname)
- ✅ "bankar" → Valid (surname)
- ✅ "bankesh" → Valid (surname)
- ❌ "bank transfer" → Invalid (contains "bank" as word)
- ❌ "paid via upi" → Invalid (contains "upi" as word)

---

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **String Splitting:**
```kotlin
val words = cleanMerchant.split("\\s+".toRegex())
```
- Splits on whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines)
- Creates list of individual words
- Handles multiple spaces correctly

### **Exact Match:**
```kotlin
if (word in invalidMerchants)
```
- Checks if word is IN the list (exact match)
- NOT `contains()` (substring match)
- Case-insensitive (already lowercased)

---

## 📁 **Files Modified**

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| ✅ `SMSManager.kt` | • Changed `contains()` to word-by-word matching<br>• Split merchant name into words<br>• Check each word individually<br>• Added debug logging |
