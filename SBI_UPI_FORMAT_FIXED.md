# ✅ SBI UPI SMS Format - NOW SUPPORTED!

## 🎯 Issue Found & Fixed

Your SBI UPI SMS were not being parsed because they use a **different format** than standard bank SMS.

### **Problem SMS Examples:**

```
1. Dear UPI user A/C X5334 debited by 2000.0 on date 06Oct25 trf to CHAITANY SANDIP Refno 530375090208

2. Your UPI-Mandate for Rs.1000.00 is successfully created towards Google from A/c No: XXXXXX5334

3. Dear UPI user A/C X5334 debited by 3000.0 on date 17Jul25 trf to CHAITANY SANDIP Refno 470529936682
```

### **Key Differences from Standard SMS:**

| Standard Format | SBI UPI Format |
|----------------|----------------|
| `Rs.2000` or `₹2000` | `debited by 2000.0` |
| `at MERCHANT` | `trf to NAME` |
| `to MERCHANT` | `towards MERCHANT` |

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### **1. Enhanced Amount Pattern**

**Before:**
```regex
(?:rs\.?|inr|₹)\s*(\d+(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d{2})?)
```
❌ Only matched: Rs.500, ₹500, INR 500

**After:**
```regex
(?:(?:rs\.?|inr|₹)\s*|(?:debited|credited)\s+by\s+)(\d+(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d{1,2})?)
```
✅ Now matches: Rs.500, ₹500, **debited by 2000.0**, **credited by 5000.0**

---

### **2. Enhanced Merchant Pattern**

**Before:**
```regex
(?:at|from|to)\s+([a-zA-Z0-9\s&.-]+?)(?:\s+on|\.|$)
```
❌ Only matched: at AMAZON, from ZOMATO, to SWIGGY

**After:**
```regex
(?:at|from|to|trf\s+to|transferred\s+to|towards)\s+([a-zA-Z0-9\s&.-]+?)(?:\s+(?:on|from|refno|umn)|\.|$)
```
✅ Now matches: at AMAZON, **trf to NAME**, **towards GOOGLE**, transferred to NAME
