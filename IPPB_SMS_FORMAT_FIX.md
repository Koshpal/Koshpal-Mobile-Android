- Transaction keywords only had "received", not the full phrase
- "received a payment" is IPPB's specific format

### **3. Merchant Pattern Not Handling "thru" Keyword** ❌
- Pattern: "from mr shivam dinesh atr thru IPPB"
- Merchant extractor was including "thru IPPB" in the merchant name

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### **1. Added IPPB to Bank Senders**

**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/koshpal_android/koshpalapp/utils/BankConstants.kt`

```kotlin
// Payment Banks
"AIRPAY", "AIRTEL", "AIRTLP",             // Airtel Payments Bank
"PAYTMB", "PAYTPB", "PAYTMP",             // Paytm Payments Bank
"FINDPB", "FINOPB",                       // Fino Payments Bank
"JIOPPB", "JIOPAY",                       // Jio Payments Bank
"IPPB", "IPPBPB", "INDIAPOST",            // India Post Payments Bank ✅ ADDED
```

**Result:**
✅ SMS from "IPPB" sender will now be recognized as bank SMS

---

### **2. Added "Received a Payment" Keywords**

**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/koshpal_android/koshpalapp/utils/BankConstants.kt`

```kotlin
val TRANSACTION_KEYWORDS = listOf(
    "debited", "credited", "debit", "credit", 
    "withdrawn", "deposited", "paid", "received",
    "spent", "transferred", "transaction", "txn",
    "purchase", "refund", "cashback", "reward", 
    "charges", "fee", "payment",
    "received a payment", "sent a payment"  // ✅ IPPB format ADDED
)
```

**Result:**
✅ SMS containing "received a payment" will be detected as transaction SMS

---

### **3. Updated Merchant Pattern to Stop at "thru"**

**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/koshpal_android/koshpalapp/engine/TransactionCategorizationEngine.kt`

**Before:**
```kotlin
private val merchantPattern = Pattern.compile(
    "(?:at|from|to|trf\\s+to|transferred\\s+to|towards)\\s+([a-zA-Z0-9\\s&.-]+?)(?:\\s+(?:on|from|refno|umn)|\\.|$)", 
    Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE
)
```

**After:**
```kotlin
// Format 4: from NAME thru BANK (IPPB format) ✅ ADDED
private val merchantPattern = Pattern.compile(
    "(?:at|from|to|trf\\s+to|transferred\\s+to|towards)\\s+([a-zA-Z0-9\\s&.-]+?)(?:\\s+(?:on|from|refno|umn|thru|through)|\\.|$)", 
    Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE
)
```

**Result:**
✅ Merchant extraction will stop at "thru" keyword
- Input: "from mr shivam dinesh atr thru IPPB"
- Extracted: "mr shivam dinesh atr" ✅
- Previously: "mr shivam dinesh atr thru IPPB" ❌

### **Transaction Type Detection:**
```kotlin
determineTransactionType(smsBody) {
    when {
        contains("received") → CREDIT  ✅ IPPB uses this
        contains("credited") → CREDIT
        contains("debited")  → DEBIT
        contains("transfer") → TRANSFER
    }
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If IPPB SMS still not working:

1. **Check Sender Name:**
   ```
   Verify SMS sender exactly matches "IPPB"
   (case-insensitive matching is enabled)
   ```

2. **Check Logs:**
   ```
   Look for: "Checking SMS from IPPB: You have received..."
   Should see: "✅ TRANSACTION SMS detected from IPPB"
   ```

3. **Verify Pattern Matching:**
   ```
   Test the regex pattern manually:
   Pattern: "from ([a-zA-Z0-9\\s&.-]+?) thru"
   Input: "from mr shivam dinesh atr thru IPPB"
   Output: "mr shivam dinesh atr" ✅
   ```

4. **Check Database:**
   ```
   Query: SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE merchant LIKE '%shivam%'
   Should return: 1 transaction with amount 10.00
   ```
