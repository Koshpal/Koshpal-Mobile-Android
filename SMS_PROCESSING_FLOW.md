# 📱 Automatic SMS Processing Flow - Koshpal App

## ✅ What's New

We've implemented **automatic SMS processing** that runs when the app launches, so users don't need to manually click buttons to extract their transaction data!

## 🔄 Complete Flow

### **1. Splash Screen (SplashActivity)**
- App launches → Shows splash screen for 1 second
- Requests SMS permissions (`READ_SMS` and `RECEIVE_SMS`)
- Checks authentication and onboarding status

### **2. Navigation Logic (SplashViewModel)**

```
User not logged in?
  ↓
  → Go to EmployeeLoginActivity

User logged in but onboarding incomplete?
  ↓
  → Go to OnboardingActivity

User logged in + onboarded BUT SMS not processed? ✨ NEW
  ↓
  → Go to SmsProcessingActivity (AUTOMATIC!)

User logged in + onboarded + SMS already processed?
  ↓
  → Go to HomeActivity
```

### **3. SMS Processing Screen (SmsProcessingActivity)** ✨ NEW

**Shows beautiful loading UI with:**
- 📊 Real-time progress status
- 📈 Live statistics:
  - Total SMS scanned
  - Payment SMS found
  - Transactions created
- ⏭️ Skip button (user can skip if needed)
- 🔄 Retry button (on error)
- ✅ Continue button (on success)

**Automatically:**
1. Scans SMS inbox (last 6 months)
2. Filters payment/transaction SMS
3. Extracts amount, merchant, category
4. Creates Transaction records
5. Shows success summary
6. **Auto-navigates to Home after 2 seconds**

### **4. Home Screen (HomeActivity)**
- Shows all extracted transactions
- Displays current month income/expenses
- Real-time balance calculations

## 📊 SMS Processing Details

### **What Gets Processed:**

Using **`SMSManager.processAllSMS()`**:

1. **Read SMS** from device inbox (last 6 months)
2. **Filter** transaction SMS:
   - Bank sender keywords: SBIINB, HDFCBK, ICICIB, etc.
   - Transaction keywords: debited, credited, paid, etc.
   - Amount patterns: ₹, Rs., INR + numbers
3. **Extract** transaction details:
   - Amount using regex
   - Merchant name
   - Transaction type (debit/credit)
4. **Categorize** automatically:
   - Food, Grocery, Transport, Shopping, etc.
   - Uses keyword matching
   - Falls back to "Others"
5. **Create** Transaction records in Room database
6. **Avoid** duplicates (checks by SMS body)

### **Processing States:**

```kotlin
sealed class SmsProcessingState {
    object Idle                          // Ready to start
    data class Processing(...)           // Currently processing
    data class Success(...)              // Completed successfully
    data class Error(...)                // Failed with error
    object PermissionDenied              // SMS permission not granted
}
```

## 🎨 UI States

### **Processing State:**
```
Status: 🔍 Scanning your SMS inbox...
Details: Reading messages from last 6 months
Progress: [=====> Loading... ]
Stats: Updating in real-time
Buttons: [Skip for now]
```

### **Success State:**
```

## 🔐 Permissions Handling

- Permission state saved and respected
